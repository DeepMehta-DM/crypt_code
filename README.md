# crypt_code
A simple basic algorithm to send a secured message to someone by using the encryption method and being able to decode by using decryption method. 

Created just for fun. You can create your own encryption-decryption key with more complexity. 

Feel free to contact me in case of any issues, further advancement, or would like to discuss more complexity and use-cases.
